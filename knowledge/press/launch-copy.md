# Launch Copy — HackerNews, Reddit, X/Twitter, LinkedIn

Pre-drafted copy for the public launch. Sequence: HN first (decide what to post in the first 60 min of US morning, ideally Tue–Thu), then Reddit within 2 hours, then X/Twitter thread, then LinkedIn.

---

## HackerNews

**Title** (max 80 chars):

```
Show HN: Open-source knowledge base for parental alienation
```

**Self-text body**:

```
Hi HN — we've been building the largest open-source reference on
parental alienation: case law, research, playbooks, jurisdiction guides,
and templates, all free under CC BY 4.0.

Repo: github.com/AntiAlienate/knowledge

What's there:
- 9 step-by-step playbooks (first 90 days, court prep, reunification
  therapy, teen cases, cross-border/Hague, accused-of-alienation,
  grandparent dynamics, working with a lawyer, documentation)
- 30 jurisdiction reference pages
- ~60 recent cross-jurisdiction rulings
- 9 profile pages on the field's leading clinicians and researchers
- 9 templates (letters, court bundle structures, prep briefs)
- 38 shareable reference cards
- An auto-accumulator polling PubMed, CrossRef, CourtListener, BAILII,
  Reddit every 25 min, pushing a daily digest

Why open source? Because the existing references in this field are
scattered across paywalled academic journals, $200/month legal
databases, and forum posts of variable accuracy. Targeted parents,
their lawyers, and the clinicians supporting them all deserve a
common starting point.

Happy to answer questions about the architecture (Python + GitHub
Contents API + scheduled cron + LLM-curated content with human review)
or the substance.

PRs welcome — especially translations, jurisdictional additions, and
corrections from clinicians whose work is referenced.

## Reddit

### r/opensource

**Title**: `Launched: Open-source knowledge base for parental alienation — CC BY 4.0`

**Body**: same as HN body, lightly adapted ("Hi r/opensource" opener)

### r/ParentalAlienation

**Title**: `New open-source repo: playbooks, case law, and resources — free, no paywall`

**Body**:

```
Sharing because some of you may find this useful.

We've put together what we believe is the largest open-source reference
on parental alienation. It's free, no signup, no email collection.

Link: github.com/AntiAlienate/knowledge

Most directly relevant if you're in the middle of a case:
- /playbooks/first-90-days.md — week-by-week if you've just realised
- /playbooks/court-prep-checklist.md — what to bring, say, avoid
- /playbooks/documentation-system.md — the four-stream approach
- /playbooks/accused-of-alienation.md — if you're the one being accused
- /jurisdictions/ — find your country / state
- /templates/ — court bundle structures, letters, log templates

Everything is CC BY 4.0 — share, adapt, translate, use however you need.

Not affiliated with any legal-service or paid product. Not legal advice.
PRs welcome if you spot errors or gaps.

### r/Custody / r/Divorce / r/Divorce\_Men

Similar to r/ParentalAlienation but emphasise:
- The documentation system
- The court prep checklist
- The "accused" playbook (relevant in both directions)

1/ We just opened the largest open-source knowledge base on parental
   alienation. Free. CC BY 4.0. No paywall.

   github.com/AntiAlienate/knowledge

   lawyers need are scattered across paywalled journals, $200/mo legal
   databases, and forum posts of variable accuracy.

   - 9 playbooks
   - 30 jurisdiction pages
   - ~60 recent rulings
   - 9 named-clinician profiles
   - 38 reference cards
   - Auto-updated daily digest

4/ The playbooks are step-by-step for parents in crisis:
   • First 90 days
   • Court prep
   • Reunification therapy
   • Teen alienation
   • Documentation system
   • Working with a lawyer
   • Accused of alienation
   • Cross-border / Hague
   • Grandparent dynamics

5/ Auto-accumulator polls PubMed, CrossRef, CourtListener, BAILII,
   Reddit every 25 minutes and pushes fresh findings into /digest/
   daily. The reference grows continuously.

6/ Named in the influencer section (with permission requests outbound):
   Bernet (Vanderbilt), Warshak, Baker, Eddy, Harman, Kruk, Woodall,
   Childress, Lorandos.

7/ Not legal advice. CC BY 4.0. PRs welcome — translations,
   jurisdictional additions, clinician corrections.

## Launch timing

**Optimal HN window**: Tuesday–Thursday, 8:30–10:30am EST (when US tech
audience is online and engagement compounds for the rest of the day).

**Reddit posts**: 1–2 hours after HN. Allows HN traffic to populate the
analytics and the repo to handle initial load.

**Twitter/X**: same window as Reddit, with main thread author tagging
2–3 high-signal accounts in the family-law / open-source spaces.

**LinkedIn**: same day or next morning. Different audience cadence.

**Avoid**: Fri afternoon, Mon morning, US public holidays, AU/NZ holidays.
