# Practitioners — Open Directory of PA Lawyers & Therapists

> Open-source directory of lawyers and therapists who specialize in parental-alienation cases, with stance characterization (recognition / critique / middle), named cases, and verified contact paths. Designed to be **machine-readable** so downstream directories, referral services, and research teams can ingest the canonical list. CC BY 4.0.

## Why this directory exists

Targeted parents, accused parents, and family lawyers all need to find practitioners with demonstrated PA case experience — and to know what side of the contested field the practitioner is on before retaining them. No comprehensive open list exists today. This is the start of one.

**Distinct from existing referral sites because:**
- Open-source (CC BY 4.0) — adapt, fork, mirror
- Machine-readable parallel (JSON) on every page for downstream ingestion
- Stance characterization is **sourced** — never inferred
- Both recognition-camp and critique-camp practitioners included
- Verified contact paths only — bar profiles, firm websites, court records, named press
- Honest gap-flagging — entries marked "not publicly confirmed" rather than guessed

## Sections

### Lawyers

* **[United States](lawyers/us/)** — 23 verified entries; JSON: [us.json](lawyers/us.json)
* **United Kingdom** — coming next (Charlotte Proudman, Right to Equality, FNF panel barristers)
* **[Canada](lawyers/ca/)** — 19 verified entries; JSON: [ca.json](lawyers/ca.json)
* **Australia / NZ** — coming next (post-2024 reform)
* **EU member states** — coming next (DE / FR / ES / IT / NL / BE)
* **[India](therapists/india/)** — 18 verified entries; JSON: [india.json](therapists/india.json)
* **[Asia (non-India)](therapists/asia/)** — SG / HK / JP; JSON: [asia.json](therapists/asia.json)
* **[Africa](therapists/africa/)** — ZA / KE / NG / GH / EG / UG / TZ / ET / ZW / NA; 33 verified entries; JSON: [africa.json](therapists/africa.json)
* **[Middle East & Türkiye](therapists/me/)** — TR / IL / LB / JO / AE / QA / SA; JSON: [me.json](therapists/me.json)

### Therapists

* **United States** — coming next ([Family Bridges](https://warshak.com/family-bridges/)-affiliated, [AB-PA](https://drcachildress.org/) practitioners, trauma-informed alternatives)
* **United Kingdom** — coming next (Family Separation Clinic, NHS-affiliated)
* Other regions — coming as research completes

### Expert Witnesses

* Coming after lawyers + therapists complete — separated because expert-witness reputation is tracked differently (forensic-evaluator track record, Daubert/Frye admissibility decisions)

## How downstream directories can pull from this

Every country page has a parallel `.json` file with the same data in this schema:

```
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "country": "US",
  "type": "lawyers",
  "practitioners": [
    {
      "name": "Full Name, JD",
      "firm": "Firm name",
      "firm_url": "https://...",
      "bar_admissions": ["NY", "FL"],
      "stance": "recognition | critique | middle",
      "stance_source": "URL or citation supporting the stance characterization",
      "named_cases": ["Case v Case, citation"],
      "primary_contact": "email or contact form URL",
      "tier": "1 | 2 | 3",
      "hook": "one-line specific reference for personalised outreach",
      "notes": "any caveats / not-publicly-confirmed flags"
    }
  ]
}
```

To ingest:

```
import json, urllib.request
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntiAlienate/knowledge/main/practitioners/lawyers/us.json"
data = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read())
for p in data["practitioners"]:
    print(p["name"], p["stance"])
```

The JSON files are the single source of truth. The markdown files are human-readable views.

## Editorial standards

Same standards as [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING/):

* **Primary sources only** — bar admission records, firm websites, published cases, court records, named press
* **Stance characterization must be sourced** — link to a published article, amicus brief, podcast appearance, or court filing that establishes the stance. Never inferred from second-hand description.
* **Working URLs throughout** — every firm URL, every case citation, every contact path must resolve
* **"Not publicly confirmed"** rather than guess for anything that can't be primary-sourced
* **Both sides included** — recognition camp, critique camp, and middle / hybrid practitioners
* **Honest gaps documented** — what we don't yet know about each entry should be flagged in `notes`

## Contributing

PRs welcome adding practitioners with:
- Verified bar admission or licensure
- At least one named case OR published article OR public stance statement
- Working firm URL and contact path
- Sourced stance characterization

PRs that add unverified entries, guess stance, or use second-hand stance attributions will be rejected per the editorial standard.
