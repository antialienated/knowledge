# Case File — Recommended Folder Structure

Three years of evidence accumulates fast. A disciplined folder structure means you can find any document in seconds, share read access with your lawyer cleanly, and survive a laptop change without losing the file.

## The structure

```
case-file/
├── README.md                          ← what's where, last updated
├── 00-orders/                          ← all court orders, named [YYYY-MM-DD]-[order-type].pdf
├── 01-pleadings/                       ← every filing, named [YYYY-MM-DD]-[party]-[filing-type].pdf

├── 08-authorities/                     ← cases + statutes + articles you cite
├── 09-bundles/                         ← prepared court bundles, by hearing date
└── 99-archive/                         ← old/superseded material
```

## Naming conventions

* Dates always **YYYY-MM-DD** at the start. This sorts chronologically by default.
* All filenames lowercase, hyphenated. No spaces.
* Each file's name should let you understand what it is without opening.

Good: `2024-03-14-mother-objection-to-contact-application.pdf`
Bad: `Document1 (3).pdf`

## Sync strategy

* **Primary store:** local laptop drive (encrypted at rest — FileVault on Mac, BitLocker on Windows).
* **Cloud sync:** Dropbox / OneDrive / Google Drive — shared folder with your lawyer.
* **Cold backup:** monthly to an external drive kept off-site.
* **Court-bundle archive:** every completed bundle gets PDF-archived under `09-bundles/[hearing-date]/`.

## What lives outside the case file

* Anything personal / unrelated to the case (your own medical records that aren't relevant, work documents, etc.).
* Your contact log working draft (keep that in the spreadsheet itself, with a dated PDF export saved into `03-evidence/` when stable).

## Sharing read access with your lawyer

Most lawyers use Dropbox, OneDrive, or a dedicated client portal. Give them read access to the top-level folder. They can read everything; only you write.

When a lawyer reads a file, they often want to annotate it. Either:
- Use a tool that supports comments (Dropbox Paper, Google Drive, OneDrive Office).
- OR create a parallel `case-file/_lawyer-notes/` folder they can write into.
